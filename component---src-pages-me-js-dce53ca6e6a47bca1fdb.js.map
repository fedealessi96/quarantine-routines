I'm Federico</h2>\n        <p>By the day I'm writing this, I'm 23 and almost ended my studies in Computer Science, in Milan.</p>\n        <p>I love playing videogames (did someone say League of Legends?) and Computer Science. I'm a Pokemon fanatic and if you need a friend\n        to share some good music to, count on me! I'm also a mega SUSHI LOVER, and I love traveling the world (hopefully next country will be Japan).\n            I also love reading, especially fantasies: Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter are always been my favorite sagas, but in these days I\n            felt in Love with His Dark Matierials by Philip Pullamn, too good to be true.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Life in quarantine</h2>\n        <p>Things changed fast in my life (as in every Italian's one) since the COVID-19 broke out. We were put under lockdown so fast that we couldn't\n        even notice. Now every habit I had has been changed, and I had to adapt to this new life style.</p>\n        <p>To defeat the boredom of everyday's life in quarantine, I decided to schedule the activity of my days.\n        I didn't want to spend all my day playing League of Legends or Pokemon Mistery Dungeon (even if I always dreamed to do it in the past...), so\n            I decided to divide my days and doing many different things, to make this lockdown period to end faster.\n            The things I kept in consideration were:\n            <p></p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Study</li>\n                <li>Study</li>\n                <li>Study</li>\n                <li>Study</li>\n                <li>Study</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            nah, just kidding. My list contains:\n            <p></p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>Sleep at least 8 hours a night</li>\n                <li>Study</li>\n                <li>Reading </li>\n                <li>Fitness</li>\n                <li>Piano lessons</li>\n                <li>IT related stuff</li>\n                <li>League of Legends ( ... )</li>\n\n                And I also try to read as many news as I can early in the morning.\n\n            </ul>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            For each activity I also tried to estimate a minimum and maximum amount of hours to dedicate to each one (at least I would felt guilty if I spent too much time with Lol and no time for\n            anything else on the same day...).\n            After creating this 'TODO' list to I thought it could be a funny idea to practice with a React framework (Gatsby.js) and create this blog, in which I would report the same things I had n the list\n            with more details attached.\n\n            I don't know if this is a good idea and if I will continue on this path the next days, but at least I learned a brand new framework and how to deploy a site on Github Pages... and, hey, I'm practicing my English ðŸ˜€\n        </p>\n\n\n    </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default MyPage;"],"sourceRoot":""}
